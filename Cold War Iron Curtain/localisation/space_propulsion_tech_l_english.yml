liquid_propellant_rocket:0 "Liquid Propellant Rocket"
liquid_propellant_rocket_short:0 "Liquid Propellant Rocket"
liquid_propellant_rocket_desc:0 "By using a mixture of aniline and nitric acid in a combustion chamber to create thrust, we can build rockets with greater mass to weight ratios, allowing greater range and speed of our rocket designs."
hybrid_propellant_rocket:0 "Hybrid Propellant Rocket"
hybrid_propellant_rocket_desc:0 "By combining liquid oxygen with rubber or high test peroxide with polyethylene, we can create rockets that are mechanically simpler with denser fuel.  We can then use this design for further improvements in range and reductions in cost for our rocket experiments."
solid_propellant_rocket:0 "Solid Propellant Rocket"
solid_propellant_rocket_desc:0 "By combining powdered aluminum with ammonium perchlorate composites, we can achieve a rocket design that uses solid fuels and oxidizers.  Though not quite as performant as liquid propellant rockets, solid propellant rockets are significantly cheaper and are far easier to maintain, reducing the amount of liquid propellant needed in a rocket design."
cryogenic_rocket:0 "Cryogenic Rocket Engines"
cryogenic_rocket_desc:0 "While oxygen and hydrogen can be used as fuels in their gaseous form, doing so on a rocket presents many challenges that make achieving orbit difficult.  However, if we cool oxygen and hydrogen into their liquid form, we can carry much more fuel and achieve much higher specific impulse.  Using a liquid fuel and oxidizer significantly improves the range of our rocket designs."

dual_mode_propulsion_rocket_desc:0 "By combining hydrazine with nitrogen tetroxide, we can design rockets that can switch between bipropellant and monopropellant modes.  This increases the mission flexibility and simplifies our rocket designs."
tri_propellant_rockets:0 "Tripropellant Rocket"
tri_propellant_rockets_desc:0 "By adding a third fuel, such as kerosene, to the LH2/LOX design, we can theoretically achieve significantly more flexible launch profiles in our rocket designs.  However, using this design significantly increases the cost of developing such rockets."
variable_thrust_solid_rocket:0 "Variable Thrust Solid Rocket"
variable_thrust_solid_rocket_desc:0 "By modifying the internal structure of solid rocket fuels, we can create a solid rocket with crude forms of thrust control, extending the range of solid rocket designs."

pre_cooled_air_breathing_rocket_engines_desc:0 "By using liquid hydrogen and ram compression, we can separate and cool oxygen from the atmosphere, significantly reducing the weight required for launch and thus dramatically reduce the cost and increase the range of our rocket designs."
pulsed_plasma_thruster:0 "Pulsed Plasma Thruster"
pulsed_plasma_thruster_desc:0 "By using electric currents to heat a fuel into a charged plasma, we can generate thrust at much higher efficiencies compared to chemical propulsion.  However, this method is limited by a low fuel flow rate and is only suitable for smaller spacecraft."
pulsed_inductive_thruster:0 "Pulsed Inductive Thruster"
pulsed_inductive_thruster_desc:0 "By using a small amount of gas, we can use electric fields to ionize and propel the gas away from the spacecraft.  These designs further improve the efficiency of our ion engines."
