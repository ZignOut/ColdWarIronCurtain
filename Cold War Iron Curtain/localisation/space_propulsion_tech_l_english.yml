 liquid_propellent_rocket:0 "Liquid Propellent Rocket"
 liquid_propellent_rocket_short:0 "Liquid Propellent Rocket"
 liquid_propellent_rocket_desc:0 "By using a mixture of aniline and nitric acid in a combustion chamber to create thrust, we can build rockets with greater mass to weight ratios, allowing greater range and speed of our rocket designs."
 hybrid_propellent_rocket:0 "Hybrid Propellent Rocket"
 hybrid_propellent_rocket_desc:0 "By combining liquid oxygen with rubber or high test peroxide with polyethylene, we can create rockets that are mechanically simpler with denser fuel.  We can then use this design for further improvements in range and reductions in cost for our rocket experiments."
 solid_propellent_rocket:0 "Solid Propellent Rocket"
 solid_propellent_rocket_desc:0 "By combining powdered aluminum with ammonium perchlorate composites, we can achieve a rocket design that uses solid fuels and oxidizers.  Though not quite as performant as liquid propellent rockets, solid propellent rockets are significantly cheaper and are far easier to maintain, reducing the amount of liquid propellent needed in a rocket design."
 cryogenic_rocket:0 "Cryogenic Rocket Engines"
 cryogenic_rocket_desc:0 "While oxygen and hydrogen can be used as fuels in their gaseous form, doing so on a rocket presents many challenges that make achieving orbit difficult.  However, if we cool oxygen and hydrogen into their liquid form, we can carry much more fuel and achieve much higher specific impulse.  Using a liquid fuel and oxidizer significantly improves the range of our rocket designs."
 dual_mode_propulsion_rocket:0 "Dual Mode Propulsion Rocket"
 dual_mode_propulsion_rocket_desc:0 "By combining hydrazine with nitrogen tetroxide, we can design rockets that can switch between bipropellent and monopropellent modes.  This increases the mission flexibility and simplifies our rocket designs."
 tri_propellent_rockets:0 "Tripropellent Rocket"
 tri_propellent_rockets_desc:0 "By adding a third fuel, such as kerosene, to the LH2/LOX design, we can theoretically achieve significantly more flexible launch profiles in our rocket designs.  However, using this design significantly increases the cost of developing such rockets."
 variable_thrust_solid_rocket:0 "Variable Thrust Solid Rocket"
 variable_thrust_solid_rocket_desc:0 "By modifying the internal structure of solid rocket fuels, we can create a solid rocket with crude forms of thrust control, extending the range of solid rocket designs."
 pre_cooled_air_breathing_rocket_engines:0 "Pre-cooled Air Breathing Rocket Engines"
 pre_cooled_air_breathing_rocket_engines_desc:0 "By using liquid hydrogen and ram compression, we can separate and cool oxygen from the atmosphere, significantly reducing the weight required for launch and thus dramatically reduce the cost and increase the range of our rocket designs."
space_propulsion_folder:0 "Space Propulsion"
space_propulsion_folder_desc:0 "Research related to developing methods of propulsion for spacecraft."
